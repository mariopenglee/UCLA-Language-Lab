      "Hi! My name is Minqi Liu. My friends call me Kiki. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Linguistics at UCLA in June 2023 and joined the Language Lab in August. I am primarily interested in first language acquisition and theoretical syntax. I employ experimental methods to address core issues in childrenâ€™s syntactic development and believe that acquisition data can inform linguistic theory in meaningful ways. Besides research, I enjoy hiking, biking, travelling, and petting my cat.      ",
